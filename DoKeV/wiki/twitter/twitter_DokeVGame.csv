Just to clarify about #DokeV:

MMO ❌
Open World Action Adventure ✔️
2 번 째 연속 트윗
#DokeV was initially introduced as an MMO, but we decided to move the game in a different direction and it's now a creature-collecting open world action-adventure.

But regardless of genre, we're going for fun, vibrant, and adventurous! 🦙☂️
